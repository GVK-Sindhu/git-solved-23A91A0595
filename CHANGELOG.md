### Phase 4: Fetch and Pull Operations
- Executed `git fetch instructor` to check for remote updates.
- Compared with `git diff main instructor/main` — minor README differences found earlier.
- Ran `git pull instructor main` — confirmed that local branch is already up to date.
- Documented 1 fetch and 1 pull as required.
